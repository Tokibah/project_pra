# Pra-Q Training

This app was developed as part of a Pra-Q (practical training) program to explore the basics of Flutter app development. It features a simple login and sign-in system, aimed at teaching user authentication, UI design, and basic navigation. However, the app was built using an older version of Flutter and its dependencies, which are now outdatedâ€”making it incompatible with the latest tools and unable to run properly on current systems.
